# PasswordCracker
An attempt at building a bare-bones password cracker in Java to further my understanding of encryption and decryption. This program uses the RockYou.txt file in order to find commonly used passwords and compares them to the password the user entered. In essence, this program simply checks to see if your password is within the RockYou.txt file. However, this project was more of an attempt to understand the vast number of encryption formats that exist, how they can be implemented in codes, and the problem with not using modern-day security practices. The code was made to be as modular and user-friendly as possible and will ask for the user to specify the file path to the list of passwords (such as RockYou). The user can also specify the hashing style (given the following provided in the code) and the password they wish to encrypt.
